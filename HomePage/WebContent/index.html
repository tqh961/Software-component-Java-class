<p> Outer space is an area of universe that is beyond the earth and between 
celestial bodies. Many people may think that outer space is just a vacuum that
has nothing in it. However, this is a misconception. The outer space contained:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Low density of particles, eg. a plasma of hydrogen and helium </li>
  <li>Electromagnetic radiation</li>
  <li>Magnetic fields</li>
  <li>Neutrinos</li>
  <li>Dust</li>
  <li>Cosmic rays</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are different regions in the outer space.
